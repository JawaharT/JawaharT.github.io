            <p>I made an automated program that outlines chondrocytes and corresponding nuclei on immunofluorecent
                images that measure YAP (protein) using multiple packages including but not limited to
                computer vision (CV2) in Python for my undergraduate BEng Biomedical Engineering dissertation.
                The dissertation involved comparing the current manual quantfication method and my automated program, link given below.
                Expanded Computational Biology knowledge with Biopython and integrated its functionality with a GUI to convert a
                given DNA sequence into its protein code. Also other Python packages such as Biopython, Scikit-Bio and Biotite.
                Also made a Heroku cloud based bioinformatics page showcasing some DNA analysis using the Biopython package in Python.
                Developed a Covid-19 section on the bioinformatics site to showcase the latest case numbers from USA, UK and India, from JHU API.
                In addition built a simple GUI based 2 player and a separate player vs computer naughts and crosses game using Python.</p>
            <p>Also developed a GUI rock, paper, scissors game that keeps a rolling record of the results and another version that uses those results
                to inform the computer's next move using a Neural Network developed using Keras. Also started revising important mathematical
                concepts such as eignavalues and eiganvectors for upcoming enrolment in MSc Computer Science.</p>

            <p>In addition exposed myself to data science and ML techniques using Python, building a large range of skillset for
                the new generation because traditional software jobs are transitioning to complex and data driven niche sectors.
                So it is imperative to get as much exposure as possible.</p>
            <p>The recently enrolled onto MSc Computer Science program from UCL. This program will help grow my advanced skills before I start my career.</p>
