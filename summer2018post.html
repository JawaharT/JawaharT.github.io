          <p>Learned Swift to start creating different types of apps on ios for iPhone.</p>

            <p>I made a weather app called Clima using cocoapods such as Corelocation to determine the GPS coordinates of the user after providing us permission.
        Also used SwiftyJSON and Alamofire to retrieve data from the OpenWeatherApp API and be able to present it the traditional way.</p>

        <p>Used Apple's CoreMl module using GitHub's Inception V3 model to create an app that can identify any type of food, animals and plants and display it on the navigation controller title.
        Briefly checked out how to convert an existing caffemodel of flowers into a CoreMl model using a Python script using coremltools module from Apple through the command line.</p>

        <p>Furthermore using ARKit I made a dice app where a new dice is placed and rolled when the user taps on the grid that appears when a surface is detected, in addition I have also made a simplified version of the measure app introduced by Apple in ios 12.
    BitcoinTicker App is another app I am glad to present as it shows the price of a single bitcoin in current time in many currencies from around the world. This used SwiftyJSON to read the JSON that Alamofire retrieved from bitcoinaverage.com similar to the setup of the Clima app.
    These are only some of the applications I have made, for more visit my Github page.</p>

    <p>Overall learning Swift helped me understand design patterns in ios are key conventions that are necessary for an app to do well in the App Store.
      Also it helped me realize how much work is required for even a simple app like Clima to function and dawned on me how other apps could be built.
    All these different techniques required decison making because after getting the app to work expressing the same functionality in fewer lines of code is another challenge where this skill is needed.
  Through use of the internet it made decision making much simpler because I found cocoapods that make some demanding work much simpler to do.</p>
