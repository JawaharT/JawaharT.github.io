          <p>This summer started making my blog site using tradtional HTML and CSS as well as some online courses on Coursera from multiple universities such as Rice, Michigan and Maryland and recieved certificates of accomplishments.
          These courses include learning python and learning how to study.
          I spent the summer doing these courses to get a grasp on how to learn during university and A-levels as well as gain knowledge on these topics which I thought could be used in the future.</p>
          <p>In school I won an award for my work in computer science and in the Spark mock interview won a Nandos gift card.
          The year overall had provided many lessons such as the best revision methods to use before exams take place and improvement in presening my ideas in front of people who I met for the first time that day.
        It was a real eye opener for me.</p>
