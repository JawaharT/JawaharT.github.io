          <p>This summer started making my blog site using tradtional HTML and CSS and hosting it on Github as well as some online courses on Coursera from multiple universities such as Rice, Michigan and Maryland and recieved certificates of accomplishments.
          These courses include learning python and learning how to study.
          I spent the summer doing these courses to get a grasp on how to learn during university and A-levels as well as gain knowledge on these topics which I thought could be used in the future.</p>

          <p>In school I won an award for my work in computer science and in the Spark mock interview won a Nandos gift card.
          The year overall had provided many lessons such as the best revision methods to use before exams take place and improvement in presening my ideas in front of people who I met for the first time that day.
        It was a real eye opener for me.</p>

        <p>During the Summer I participated in NCS. It consisted of three weeks living outside my comfort zone. During the first week I was assisgned as the project manager to lead the group through a maze.
          Through this experience I learned how to communicate my ideas on guiding everyone through the maze without leaving anyone behind or having any rogue members abandoning the cause.
          I was able to succeed in convincing others in the group to follow me because I presuaded them that my way was the best for everybody to move out efficiently and quickly as it was used by others before us.
          In the second week we had to work together to form a campaign on an issue and engage the local community this taught me how teamwork and organisation is important in spreading awareness and making sure our itinerary is done on time.
          The issue we chose to spread awareness on litter and how damaging it is to global climate. I personally became more responsible when it comes to waste disposal as a result.</p>
