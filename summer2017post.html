          <p>I continued learning Python from 2015 by doing some coding challenges from HackerRank and ProjectEuler these tasks involved problem solving.
              In order to complete them I had to spend time understanding key concepts in the language such as if statements, for/while loops and function creation which are required to solve such problems in traditional object oriented programming (OOP).
              As a result I was able to complete relatively simple tasks such as coding a fibonacci program.</p>
          <p>Also I got involved in a placement at St Peter's Hospital as well as shadowing doctors at a heart hospital in India.
              I learnt how they operate and how key patient documents are kept and tracked throughout the inpatient process.
              The National Health Service in the UK keeps a record of all patients in an electronic database but some important notes from the physision is also in paper form.
              While in India its nearly all kept in paper form and is with the patients.
              I gained valuable experience in responsibity because working as a porter at St Peter's Hospital comes with pushing patients on beds or wheelchairs around the hospital from the wards.
              From then onwards I realised how difficult it is to work at a hospital and how some staff are underappreciated for their commitment.</p>
          <p>I was able to gain valuable experience on how healthcare can differ which especially in India it can be difficult to keep a track on such a large population.
              This is why I think the Adhaar card in India is important because if used properly they can keep records of Indian citizens in a more efficient way than the Government is now.
              But on the other hand if cybersecurity is not handled with care then personal information of thousands of people will be at risk.</p>
